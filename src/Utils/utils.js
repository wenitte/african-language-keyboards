    Nko: "N'Ko (N'Ko: ߒߞߏ) is a script devised by Solomana Kante in 1949, as a modern writing system for the Mandé languages of West Africa. The term N'Ko, which means I say in all Mandé languages, is also used for the Mandé literary standard written in N'Ko script. The script is written in a right-to-left direction  and the letters which are connected at the base.It is obligatory to mark both tone and vowels. N'Ko tones are marked as diacritics.Kante created N'Ko to provide a better way to write Mandé languages, which had for centuries been written in predominately in Ajami script, which was not perfectly suited to the tones unique to Mandé and common to many West African languages. Kante devised N'Ko as he was in Bingerville, Côte d'Ivoire and later brought to Kante's natal region of Kankan, Guinea. N'Ko began to be used in many educational books when the script is believed to have been finalized on April 14, 1949 (now N'Ko Alphabet Day); Kante had transcribed from religious to scientific and philosophical literature, even a dictionary.These materials were given as gifts into other Mandé-speaking parts of West Africa. The script received its first specially made typewriter from Eastern Europe back when Guinea had ties with the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The introduction of the script led to a movement promoting literacy in the N'Ko script among Mandé speakers in both Anglophone and Francophone West Africa. N'Ko literacy was instrumental in shaping the Maninka cultural identity in Guinea, and it has also strengthened the Mandé identity in other parts of West Africa. N’ko script has been used to write many non Mande West African languages as well including Mooré , Twi, and Yoruba as well as Bantu languages like Swahili and Lingala.",
    Adlam: "The Adlam script is a script used to write Fulfulde, the Fulani language (also known as Peuhl or Pulaar). The name Adlam is an acronym derived from the first four letters of the alphabet (A, D, L, M), standing for Alkule Dandayɗe Leñol Mulugol (𞤀𞤤𞤳𞤵𞤤𞤫 𞤁𞤢𞤲𞤣𞤢𞤴𞤯𞤫 𞤂𞤫𞤻𞤮𞤤 𞤃𞤵𞤤𞤵𞤺𞤮𞤤), which means the alphabet that protects the peoples from vanishing. Abdoulaye and Ibrahima Barry grew up in Guinea, West Africa. Few people in their town could read, and their father, who could, acted as a designated reader. The existing ways to write Fulfulde gave only an inconsistent approximation of the sounds of the spoken language, so In 1989, Ibrahima, then fourteen, and Abdoulaye, then set about inventing Adlam. The first iteration was cursive, but people found it hard to discern the individual letters, so in their second iteration, the brothers separated the letters. When Ibrahima left to study at the University of Conakry, he took the script with him, and it began to be used in classes. To provide content, they wrote books of practical advice – how to conduct a healthy pregnancy, how to filter water to make it drinkable – and a newspaper. Today Adlam is used in Guinea as well as the 23 other West African countries where Fulfulde is spoken, and has also been used to write neighboring languages, such as Hausa.",
    Vai:"The Vai syllabary is a syllabic writing system devised for the Vai language by Momolu Duwalu Bukele of Jondu, in what is now Grand Cape Mount County, Liberia. Bukele is regarded within the Vai community, as well as by most scholars, as the syllabary's inventor and chief promoter when it was first documented in the 1830s. It is one of the two most successful indigenous scripts in West Africa in terms of the number of current users and the availability of literature written in the script, the other being N'Ko",
    Gʋlse: "The Gur languages, also known as Central Gur or Mabia, belong to the Niger–Congo language family. There are about 70 languages belonging to this group. They are spoken in the Sahelian and savanna regions of West Africa, namely: in most areas of Burkina Faso, and in south-central Mali, northeastern Ivory Coast, the northern halves of Ghana and Togo, northwestern Benin, and southwestern Niger. Additionally, a single Gur language, Baatonum, is spoken in the extreme northwest of Nigeria. Like most Niger–Congo languages, the ancestor of Gur languages probably had a noun class system; many of today's languages have reduced this to a system of nominal genders or declensions or no longer have a class system.A common property of Gur languages is the verbal aspect marking. Almost all Gur languages are tonal, with Koromfé being a notable exception. The tonal systems of Gur languages are rather divergent. Most Gur languages have been described as following the model of a two tone downstep system, but the languages of Oti-Volta branch and some others have three phonemic tones. The most spoken Gur language is Mooré, the language of the Mossi people. Mooré is spoken by over 12 million people in Burkina Faso, plus another 5M+ in surrounding countries such as Ghana, Cote D'ivoire, Niger, Mali and Togo as a native language, but with many more L2 speakers. Mooré is spoken as a first or second language by over 50% of the Burkinabè population . The colonization of Africa and conquering of Gur speaking nations have led to the marginalization of indegenous writing systems and the endangerment of Gur languages. Colonial governments prioritized the use of European colonial languages such as English and French which use the latin script, and today most Gur languages are written with modified latin scripts, Ajami scripts, or N’ko script. None of these writing systems are well suited to the tones unique to Gur languages. The natural evolution of pre colonial Gur writing systems was unfortunately stifled by colonial regimes and lack of government desire to promote indegenous writing systems post independence. Goulsse (meaning writing in Mooré) is a modern script for writing Gur languages. The script was developed by Wenitte Apiou and Babaguioue Micareme Akouabou in 2022. Born in Burkina Faso to a Kassena father and a Mossi mother, Apiou was a student of Computer Science at Stanford University when he contacted Babaguioue, also Burkinabè Kassena, and a doctoral candidate in Linguistics with research focus on the Kassena language at the University of Ouagadougou. The script is an alphabet with 30 letters. Goulsse draws inspiration from ancient writing systems used in the Volta region where Gur languages are spoken, and represents the community’s idea of how these writing systems may have further evolved if Gur peoples had never been colonized. Goulsse is written from left to right, has no uppercase or lowercase, and uses the standard international Hindu-Arabic numerals."
